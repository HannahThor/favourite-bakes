To help familiarise myself with Next.js [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) and component libraries,  I decided to make a page which showcased all of my BBC Good Food bakes. 

After having a brief introduction to Next.js on what I've coined as the Choas Hackathon, I felt I needed a do over. Stripped back to basics this was the perfect project to re-introduce the core fundamentals.

I used shadcn/ui (https://ui.shadcn.com/) component library, I loved that the components had such a clean design and were customisable. 

Enjoy my most baked treats of 2023.
